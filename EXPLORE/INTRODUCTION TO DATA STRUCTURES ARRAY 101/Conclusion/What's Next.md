# What's Next?

Let's recap what we looked at in this explore card:

-   We explored what the Array data structure is all about.
-   We looked at the Java syntax for creating Arrays.
-   We looked at the Java syntax for reading and writing from Arrays.
-   We designed basic insertion, deletion, and search algorithms for Arrays.
-   We played around with in-place Array algorithms.
-   We solved heaps of fun and exciting problems!

Here at LeetCode, we've already started developing a follow-up Arrays Explore Card! In that card, we'll be going over some more advanced techniques for working with Arrays.

What other techniques could there be with Arrays, you might be wondering? Well, wonder no more. Here is a quick taster!

For now though, here's a few last questions for you to really practice what you've learned, and to get prepared for the next Arrays Explore Card!
