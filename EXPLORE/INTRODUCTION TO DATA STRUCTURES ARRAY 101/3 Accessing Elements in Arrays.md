 Accessing Elements in Arrays

___

> The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them. All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations.

  

### Writing Items into an Array

___

To put a DVD into the Array, we need to decide which of the 15 places we'd like it to go in. Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of `0` to `N - 1`. The 1st place is `0`, the 2nd place is `1`, the 3rd place is `2`... all the way up to the 15th place, which is `14`. We call these numbers that identify each place **indexes**.

Let's put the DVD for _The Avengers_ into the eighth place of the Array we created above.

```
// Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");

// Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
// started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;
```

And that's it. We've put the DVD for _The Avengers_ into our Array! Let's put a few more DVD's in.

```
DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");

// Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

// Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

// Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;
```

Notice that we put _The Incredibles_ into the Array at index `3`. What happens if we now run this next piece of code?

```
DVD starWarsDVD = new DVD("Star Wars", 1977, "George Lucas");
dvdCollection[3] = starWarsDVD;
```

Because we just put _Star Wars_ into the Array at index `3`, _The Incredibles_ is no longer in the Array. It has been overwritten! If we still have the `incrediblesDVD` variable _in scope_, then the DVD still exists in the computer's memory. If not though, it's totally gone!

  

### Reading Items from an Array

We can check what's at a particular Array index.

```
// Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, and 3.
System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[10]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);

// Will print:

// The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, released in 2012
// null
// Star Wars, directed by George Lucas, released in 1977
```

Notice that because we haven't yet put anything at index 10, the value it contains is `null`. In other languages, such as **C**, the Array slot could contain completely random data. Java always initializes empty Array slots to `null` if the Array contains _objects_, or to default values if it contains _primitive types_. For example, the array `int []` would contain the default value of `0` for each element, `float[]` would contain default values of `0.0`, and `bool[]` would contain default values of `false`.

  

### Writing Items into an Array with a Loop

___

We commonly use a loop to put lots of values into an Array. To illustrate this, let's go to another example. This time, we're going to create an Array of `int`s and put the first `10` square numbers into it.

```
int[] squareNumbers = new int[10];

// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // We need to be careful with the 0-indexing. The next square number
    // is given by (i + 1) * (i + 1).
    // Calculate it and insert it into the Array at index i.
    int square = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
    squareNumbers[i] = square;
}
```

  

### Reading Items from an Array with a Loop

___

We can also use a loop to print out everything that's in the Array.

```
// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Access and print what's at the i'th index.
    System.out.println(squareNumbers[i]);
}

// Will print:
// 1
// 4
// 9
// 16
// 25
// 36
// 49
// 64
// 81
// 100
```

One last thing worth knowing now is that there's a more elegant way of printing out the values of an Array—a variant of the `for` loop, commonly referred to as a "for each" loop.

```
// For each VALUE in the Array.
for (int square : squareNumbers) {
    // Print the current value of square.
    System.out.println(square);
}
// Prints exactly the same as the previous example.
```

You'll probably agree that this code is a lot simpler to read. We can use it whenever we don't need the index values. For actually _writing_ the squares into the Array, it wouldn't have worked because we needed to work with the actual index numbers. You don't _have_ to use a "for each" loop when you're starting out, but we recommend you become comfortable with it before interviews. Simple, elegant code is good code!
