# Search in an Array

> Finally, we're going to look at the most important operation of all. More often than not, it comes down to the speed of searching for an element in a data structure that helps programmers make design choices for their codebases.

There's more than one way of searching an Array, but for now, we're going to focus on the simplest way. Searching means to find an occurrence of a particular element in the Array and return its position. We might need to search an Array to find out whether or not an element is present in the Array. We might also want to search an Array that is arranged in a specific fashion to determine which index to insert a new element at.

If we know the index in the Array that _may_ contain the element we're looking for, then the search becomes a constant time operationâ€”we simply go to the given index and check whether or not the element is there.

### Linear Search

---

If the index is not known, which is the case most of the time, then we can check every element in the Array. We continue checking elements until we find the element we're looking for, or we reach the end of the Array. This technique for finding an element by checking through all elements one by one is known as the **linear search** algorithm. In the worst case, a linear search ends up checking the entire Array. Therefore, the time complexity for a linear search is O(N)O(N)O(N).

Let's see the linear search algorithm in action, with all the edge cases handled properly. When we say _edge cases_, we basically mean scenarios that you wouldn't expect to encounter. For example, the element you're searching for might not even exist in the Array. Or, an even rarer, but possible, scenario is that the input Array doesn't contain any elements at all, or perhaps it is `null`. It's important to handle all of these edge cases within the code


```
public static boolean linearSearch(int[] array, int length, int element) {
    // Check for edge cases. Is the array null or empty?
    // If it is, then we return false because the element we're
    // searching for couldn't possibly be in it.
    if (array == null || length == 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Carry out the linear search by checking each element,
    // starting from the first one.
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        // We found the element at index i.
        // So we return true to say it exists.
        if (array[i] == element) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // We didn't find the element in the array.
    return false;
}
```
